### PhD Thesis

My thesis is titled **Exploring Sources of Variability in Metal Organic 
Frameworks Through High Throughput Adsorption and Calorimetric Methods** 
and was defended in 2018 in Aix-Marseille Université, France in front of 
the following jury:

*   Prof. Bogdan Kuchta (_president of the jury_)
*   Dr. Flor Siperstein (_reviewer_)
*   Dr. Rob Ameloot (_reviewer_)
*   Prof. Stefan Kaskel (_examinator_)
*   Dr. Philip Llewelyn (_thesis director_)

The text is currently under a one-year embargo, but it's available 
upon request.

### Others

Member of the organisation board for the DocMOF 2018 conference in
Raitenhaslach, Germany. This was the first PhD student organised
symposium on Metal-Organic Frameworks and a massive success, with
over 100 attendees from 70 institutions and 10 countries. I was
also responsible for the event website: <http://www.docmof.com>.

In 2017 spent 6 weeks in the Center for Surface Chemistry 
and Catalysis in Leuven, Belgium, focusing on MOF synthesis and 
defect generation, with several prototypical materials such as
UiO-66 and ZIF-8.

# Programming

I enjoy programming as well as automation, and have worked extensively
in Python, C++, Matlab as well as some experience with Webdesign.
Below are some of my projects.

### pyGAPS

[pyGAPS](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pyGAPS) is an adsorption 
isotherm processing and fitting framework written in Python 3.
It is open source and extensively documented. Some of the capabilities are:
routine material characterisation (specific surface area, pore volume,
pore size distribution), isotherm model fitting as well as multicomponent
adsorption prediction using IAST.

### This website

My [personal website](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pauliacomi.github.com).
A static site using GitHub Pages, Jekyll and a theme adapted from the
open source GitHub Cayman theme. Nothing too fancy.
