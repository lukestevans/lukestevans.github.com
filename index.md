# Hi

**My name is Paul and I am a researcher studying novel adsorbent materials**

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the 
[DAMP](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE29-0003) 
team at the Institut Charles Gerhard Montpellier, researching
the interplay between mechanical pressure and adsorption in porous materials.
More details about this ANR-funded project can be found 
[here](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE29-0003).

Previously I was studying adsorption-induced flexibility in Metal-Organic 
Framework (MOF) crystals using calorimetric techniques in the EnAP team in
[MADIREL](http://madirel.univ-amu.fr/node/99). Some background is available  
[here](http://www.anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE08-0048).

My [work](/projects) also includes other aspects of MOFs such as structural
defects, synthesis and shaping, as well as characterisation through 
adsorption and microcalorimetry.

I am familiar with a variety of scientific characterisation techniques,
as well as some experience with R&D and Supply Chain, which you can find 
out more about [here](/about).
