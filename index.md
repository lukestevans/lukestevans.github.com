**My name is Paul and I am a post-doctoral fellow studying
gas adsorption in novel materials**

Right now I am researching adsorption-induced flexibility in Metal-Organic 
Framework (MOF) crystals using calorimetric techniques in the EnAP team in
[MADIREL](http://madirel.univ-amu.fr/node/99). More info about this 
ANR project can be found 
[here](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE08-0048).

My [work](/projects) also includes other aspects of MOFs such as structural
defects, synthesis and shaping, as well as characterisation through 
adsorption and microcalorimetry.

I am familiar with a variety of scientific characterisation techniques,
as well as some experience with R&D and Supply Chain, which you can find 
out more about [here](/about).

I am currently looking to pursue a career in industrial research.
