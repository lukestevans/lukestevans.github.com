# Programming

I enjoy programming as well as automation, and have worked extensively in Python, C++,
Matlab as well as some experience with web design. Below are some of my projects.

### pyGAPS

[pyGAPS](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pyGAPS) is an adsorption isotherm processing and
fitting framework written in Python 3. It is open source and extensively documented. Some
of the capabilities are: routine material characterisation (specific surface area, pore
volume, pore size distribution), isotherm model fitting as well as multicomponent
adsorption prediction using IAST.

### This website

My [personal website](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pauliacomi.github.com). A static site
using GitHub Pages, Jekyll and a theme adapted from the open source GitHub Cayman theme.
Nothing too fancy.
