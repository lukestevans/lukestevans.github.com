# Software

I enjoy letting computers do the work for me, and have worked extensively in Python and
C++ to make this happen. In the hopes that the things I made can also help others, they
are released as open source code. I also dabble in web design and several other languages.
Below are some of my projects.

### pyGAPS

[pyGAPS](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pyGAPS) is an adsorption isotherm processing and
fitting framework written in Python 3. It is open source and extensively documented. Some
of the capabilities are: routine material characterisation (specific surface area, pore
volume, pore size distribution), isotherm model fitting as well as multicomponent
adsorption prediction using IAST.

### pyGAPS-GUI

A [graphical user interface](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pyGAPS-gui) to the pyGAPS
package, written in Qt (using Python bindings). This is currently a work in progress.

### This website

My [personal website](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pauliacomi.github.com). A static site
using GitHub Pages, Jekyll and a theme adapted from the open source GitHub Cayman theme.
Nothing too fancy.
