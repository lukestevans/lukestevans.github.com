### PhD Thesis

My thesis is titled **Exploring Sources of Variability in Metal Organic
Frameworks Through High Throughput Adsorption and Calorimetric Methods** and was
defended in 2018 in Aix-Marseille Université, France in front of the following
jury:

* Prof. Bogdan Kuchta (_president of the jury_)
* Dr. Flor Siperstein (_reviewer_)
* Dr. Rob Ameloot (_reviewer_)
* Prof. Stefan Kaskel (_examinator_)
* Dr. Philip Llewelyn (_thesis director_)

### Other roles and collaborations

Member of the organisation board for the DocMOF 2018 conference in
Raitenhaslach, Germany. This was the first PhD student organised symposium on
Metal-Organic Frameworks and a massive success, with over 100 attendees from 70
institutions and 10 countries. I was also responsible for the event website.

In 2017 spent 6 weeks in the Center for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis in
Leuven, Belgium, focusing on MOF synthesis and defect generation, with several
prototypical materials such as UiO-66 and ZIF-8.
