# Hello

### I am a researcher studying novel adsorbent materials

I am a researcher in the field of adsorption, currently developing and
supporting state-of-the-art gravimetric sorption devices over at
[Surface Measurement Systems](https://surfacemeasurementsystems.com/). My main
research topic is looking at surfaces, interfaces and porous materials through
the adsorption of gases. Some of my papers can be found in the
[work](/academic) section.

In my previous academic positions at [ICGM](https://www.icgm.fr) and
[MADIREL](http://madirel.univ-amu.fr/node/99) I have looked at how flexible
metal-organic frameworks react to
[external](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE29-0003)
[stimuli](http://www.anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE08-0048) such as pressure,
temperature and adsorbed guests, how to make adsorbent-based sensors for
detecting contaminants in satellites, and how defects influence the adsorption
and separation properties in crystalline hybrid porous materials.

I also develop open-source [software](/software) for various scientific
applications. Some more stuff about me is [here](/about).
