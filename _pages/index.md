# Hello

### I am a scientist building new ways to characterize porous and finely divided materials

I am a scientist in the field of adsorption, leading the development of
state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation over at
[Surface Measurement Systems](https://surfacemeasurementsystems.com/), where I
hold a
[Future Leaders Fellowship](https://surfacemeasurementsystems.com/dr-iacomi-fellowshop-0812/).

My main interest is finding new ways of looking at solid surfaces, interfaces
and pores through the sorption of gases. In my previous academic positions at
[ICGM](https://www.icgm.fr) and [MADIREL](http://madirel.univ-amu.fr/node/99) I
have looked at how flexible metal-organic frameworks react to
[external](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE29-0003)
[stimuli](http://www.anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE08-0048) such as pressure,
temperature and adsorbed guests, how to make adsorbent-based sensors for
detecting contaminants in satellites, and how defects influence the adsorption
and separation properties in crystalline hybrid porous materials.

More info about me is [here](/about). You can find my peer reviewed publications
the [work](/academic) section. Once in a blue moon I [write](/posts) about
current interests, though I'm usually too caught up with other things.

I also develop open-source [software](/software) for various scientific and
academic use cases, mainly related to sorption.

I am always interested in new collaborations, so if you have an idea for a
project, would like to use my [tools](/software), or just say hi, please do get
in touch [by email](mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}) or through one of my
socials in the sidebar!
