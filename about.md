# About me

Chemical engineer turned researcher with a PhD in Material Science, 
a highly practical outlook and industrial experience in Supply Chain
and R&D. Enjoy solving problems, automation and obtaining insights from
large datasets.

I have a comprehensive background in the adsorption of 
gasses and vapours, with a focus on gas storage and separation, as well as
intimate knowledge of porous coordination polymers, their 
characterisation, synthesis and avenues of application.
Some experience in statistical analysis, rheology and colorimetry.
Familiar with many characterisation techniques,
such as thermal analysis (microcalorimetry, TGA, DSC),
spectroscopy (XRD, IR, UV) and other 
qualitative and quantitative methods (NMR, GC, MS).
Skilled in programming with Python, C++ and several other languages,
primarily for high throughput data processing and automation.

I moved from my native Romania to the UK to study Chemical Engineering
in Manchester and graduated with a first class degree. While working 
for a year in AkzoNobel ICI paints during my degree, I realised I 
enjoy research and problem solving, especially when a clear goal is
envisaged.

I applied for a EU Marie Curie PhD studentship to study adsorption
in novel materials, such as Metal-Organic Frameworks. Under the mantle
of project [DEFNET](http://www.defnet-etn.eu/), I moved to Marseille,
France to dedicate three years to understand the influence of 
structural defects in MOFs on their adsorption performance and surface
energetics in the [MADIREL](http://madirel.univ-amu.fr/node/99) 
research lab. I also developed a greater interest in MOFs, 
with some of my work pertaining to their shaping, characterisation and 
unique properties such as compliance.

In addition to my experimental work, I am interested in programming,
particularly in regards to high throughput data processing, extraction
of key performance indicators from large datasets and automation.
I am self taught in Python and C++ and know my way around many other
IT areas.
