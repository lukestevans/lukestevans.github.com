# About me

Chemical engineer turned researcher with a PhD in Material Science, 
a highly practical outlook and industrial experience in Supply Chain
and R&D. Enjoy solving problems, automation and obtaining insights from
large datasets. I have a comprehensive background in the adsorption of 
gasses and vapours, with a focus on gas storage and separation, as well as
intimate knowledge of porous coordination polymers, their 
characterisation, synthesis and avenues of application.
Some experience in statistical analysis, rheology and colorimetry.
Familiar with many characterisation techniques,
such as thermal analysis (microcalorimetry, TGA, DSC),
spectroscopy (XRD, IR, UV) and other 
qualitative and quantitative methods (NMR, GC, MS).
Skilled in programming with Python, C++ and several other languages,
primarily for high throughput data processing and automation.
