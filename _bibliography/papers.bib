The near-absence of hysteresis upon cycling exhibited by this robust MOF, akin to an ideal molecular spring, is associated with a constant work energy storage capacity of 40 J g               -1               . Molecular simulations were further deployed to uncover the free-energy landscape behind this unprecedented pressure-responsive phenomenon in the area of compliant hybrid porous materials.

The isotherms obtained through volumetric or gravimetric experiments impart insight through their features but can also be analysed to determine material characteristics such as specific surface area, pore size distribution, surface energetics, or used for predicting mixture adsorption. The pyGAPS (Python General Adsorption Processing Suite) framework was developed to address the need for high-throughput processing of such adsorption data, independent of the data origin, while also being capable of presenting individual results in a user-friendly manner. It contains many common characterisation methods such as: Brunauer\textendash Emmett\textendash Teller and Langmuir surface area, t and {$\alpha$}s plots, pore size distribution calculations (Barrett\textendash Joyner\textendash Halenda, Dollimore\textendash Heal, Horvath\textendash Kawazoe, DFT/NLDFT kernel fitting), isosteric enthalpy calculations, ideal adsorbed solution theory~calculations, isotherm modelling and more, as well as the ability to import and store data from Excel, CSV, JSON and SQLite databases. In this work, a description of the capabilities of pyGAPS is presented. The code is then be used in two case studies: a routine characterisation of a UiO-66(Zr) sample and in the processing of an adsorption dataset of a commercial carbon (Takeda 5A) for applications in gas separation.},

  abstract = {Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have long been recognized as a prominent subset of the metal-organic framework (MOF) family, in part because of their ease of synthesis and good thermal and chemical stability, alongside attractive properties for diverse potential applications. Prototypical ZIFs like ZIF-8 have become embodiments of the significant promise held by porous coordination polymers as next-generation designer materials. At the same time, their intriguing property of experiencing significant structural changes upon the application of external stimuli such as temperature, mechanical pressure, guest adsorption, or electromagnetic fields, among others, has placed this family of MOFs squarely under the umbrella of stimuli-responsive materials. In this review, we provide an overview of the current understanding of the triggered structural and electronic responses observed in ZIFs (linker and bond dynamics, crystalline and amorphous phase changes, luminescence, etc.). We then describe the state-of-the-art experimental and computational methodology capable of shedding light on these complex phenomena, followed by a comprehensive summary of the stimuli-responsive nature of four prototypical ZIFs: ZIF-8, ZIF-7, ZIF-4, and ZIF-zni. We further expose the relevant challenges for the characterization and fundamental understanding of responsive ZIFs, including how to take advantage of their flexible properties for new application avenues.},

  abstract = {We characterise the elastic properties of molecular building blocks and how they impact the mechanical properties of soft porous crystals.           ,                             Framework materials at the molecular level, such as metal\textendash organic frameworks (MOF), were recently found to exhibit exotic and counterintuitive micromechanical properties. Stimulated by host\textendash guest interactions, these so-called soft porous crystals can display counterintuitive adsorption phenomena such as negative gas adsorption (NGA). NGA materials are bistable frameworks where the occurrence of a metastable overloaded state leads to pressure amplification upon a sudden framework contraction. How can we control activation barriers and energetics               via               functionalization of the molecular building blocks that dictate the frameworks' mechanical response? In this work we tune the elastic and inelastic properties of building blocks at the molecular level and analyze the mechanical response of the resulting frameworks. From a set of 11 frameworks, we demonstrate that widening of the backbone increases stiffness, while elongation of the building blocks results in a decrease in critical yield stress of buckling. We further functionalize the backbone by incorporation of sp               3               hybridized carbon atoms to soften the molecular building blocks, or stiffen them with sp               2               and sp carbons. Computational modeling shows how these modifications of the building blocks tune the activation barriers within the energy landscape of the guest-free bistable frameworks. Only frameworks with free energy barriers in the range of 800 to 1100 kJ mol               -1               per unit cell, and moderate yield stress of 0.6 to 1.2 nN for single ligand buckling, exhibit adsorption-induced contraction and negative gas adsorption. Advanced experimental               in situ               methodologies give detailed insights into the structural transitions and the adsorption behavior. The new framework DUT-160 shows the highest magnitude of NGA ever observed for nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. Our computational and experimental analysis of the energetics and mechanical response functions of porous frameworks is an important step towards tuning activation barriers in dynamic framework materials and provides critical design principles for molecular building blocks leading to pressure amplifying materials.},

  abstract = {Expanding populations and growing economies result in higher energy needs. Meeting this increasing demand, while lowering carbon emissions, calls for a broad energy mix and commercial deployment of solutions like carbon capture and carbon removal technologies. The scale-up of these solutions is partially hindered by the lack of materials-related information, particularly in the case of solid adsorption-based carbon capture technologies. Furthermore, experimental measurement parameters used and how data is presented lack uniformity, which makes material comparisons extremely difficult. This review examines the current state of solid sorbent characterization for carbon capture, exploring physical and chemical properties, performance parameters, and process indicators. Adsorbent performance parameters demonstrate to be the crucial link between intrinsic material properties and the overall adsorption process effectiveness and therefore are the focus of this work. This paper outlines the relevant techniques used to measure Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to adsorption performance such as CO               2               adsorption capacity, selectivity, kinetics, ease of regeneration, stability, adsorbent cost, and environmental impact. Additionally, this study highlights the relevant experimental conditions for diluted versus concentrated CO               2               streams. Lastly, efforts in harmonizing experimental data sets are considered, and an outlook on solid sorbent characterization for carbon capture processes is presented. Overall, the aim of this work is to provide the reader a critical understanding of KPIs from atomic to process scale, highlighting the importance of experimental data throughout.},
